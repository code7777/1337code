understanding the difference between a **thread** and a **process** is key to grasping how modern operating systems manage multitasking.

## üßµ **Thread vs Process** ‚Äì Core Differences

| Feature            | **Process**                                            | **Thread**                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | An independent program in execution                    | A lightweight unit of execution within a process     |
| **Memory**         | Has its **own memory space** (heap, stack, data, code) | Shares memory with other threads in the same process |
| **Isolation**      | Fully isolated from other processes                    | Not isolated ‚Äî can directly access shared memory     |
| **Overhead**       | High ‚Äî context switch is expensive                     | Low ‚Äî faster to switch between threads               |
| **Communication**  | Inter-process communication (IPC) is complex           | Threads communicate easily via shared variables      |
| **Crash behavior** | Crash affects only that process                        | Crash may bring down the entire process              |
| **Creation**       | Slower to create, OS-heavy setup                       | Faster, uses less resources                          |
| **Example**        | `firefox.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `python.exe`              | A browser tab, JavaScript engine, or audio handler   |

## üß† Visual Example:

Imagine a word processor like Microsoft Word:

* **Process**: Word itself is a process.
* **Threads**:

  * One thread handles user input (typing).
  * Another thread checks spelling in the background.
  * Another thread autosaves your document.

All these threads share the same document (memory), so they can work together efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary:

* A **process** is like a container with its own private resources.
* A **thread** is like a worker inside that container that shares the container‚Äôs tools and materials with other workers.

Would you like a diagram or code example to see how they work in practice?
