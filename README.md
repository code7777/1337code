nothing special just 1337 code

I've been on leetcode for 6 years and have solved about 98 leetcode problems. I currently have only around 8 answers uploaded to github. I tend to use leetcode more when I am interviewing for jobs . Some of the problems include Java, SQL, Javascript, Python , and C++ . Adding all the problems to github is a low priority for me right now so I may or may not
add all the problems to github but I will probably add the new problems I am working on.

I decided to keep adding to my leetcode repo. I have quite a few submissions from my senior year of college and the first couple years after graduating that I will add to the repo once I find them on my leetcode acount. I will also be solving new problems. I am a bit rusty on my data structures and algorithms so it is time for me to review to help with coding interviews as well as brushing up with DSA.
