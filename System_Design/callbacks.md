The difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous callbacks** lies in **when** the callback function is executed in relation to the main program flow:

---

### âœ… **Synchronous Callback**

* **Executed immediately** during the function call.
* **Blocking**: the program waits for the callback to finish before moving on.
* Often used in **simple, sequential logic**.

#### ðŸ”§ Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback();  // this runs right away, before greet finishes
}

greet("World", function() {
  console.log("Nice to meet you!");
});
```

**Output:**

```
Hello World
Nice to meet you!
```

---

### âœ… **Asynchronous Callback**

* Executed **later**, usually after some operation (like I/O or a timer) completes.
* **Non-blocking**: the program moves on without waiting.
* Common in **network requests**, **file reading**, and **timers**.

#### ðŸ”§ Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Async Callback");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
Async Callback
```

The `"Async Callback"` runs after a delay, **after** the rest of the code has finished.

### ðŸ§  Summary

| Feature   | Synchronous                | Asynchronous                   |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Timing    | Executes immediately       | Executes later                 |
| Blocking? | Yes                        | No                             |
| Use Case  | Simple logic, calculations | I/O, timers, network requests  |
| Code Flow | Top-down, predictable      | May jump when the task is done |
