**High cohesion** and **low coupling** are two key principles in software design that help make code more maintainable, understandable, and reusable.

### ðŸ”· **High Cohesion** â€” "Each part does one thing well"

* **Definition**: A component (like a class, module, or function) has high cohesion if all its parts are closely related and work together to perform a single, well-defined task.
* **Example**: A `UserService` that handles user registration, login, and profile updates is cohesive. If it also started handling payments, that would lower cohesion.
* **Benefits**:

  * Easier to understand and reason about.
  * Easier to test.
  * Encourages reusability and clarity.

### ðŸ”· **Low Coupling** â€” "Each part works independently"

* **Definition**: Coupling measures how much one component depends on others. Low coupling means changes in one module/class have little or no impact on others.
* **Example**: If a `PaymentService` doesn't rely directly on the inner workings of `OrderService`, but interacts through well-defined interfaces, thatâ€™s low coupling.
* **Benefits**:

  * Easier to modify or replace parts of the system.
  * Fewer ripple effects from changes.
  * Better scalability and testability.

### âœ… Ideal Design

A system with **high cohesion and low coupling** is:

* Modular
* Easier to debug and maintain
* Flexible for future changes

---

### ðŸš« Poor Design Example:

A `GodObject` class that handles user input, database operations, and UI rendering â€” thatâ€™s low cohesion. If it also breaks every time you tweak a different class, that's high coupling.
