In C++, an **inline member** in a class refers to either:

### 1. **Inline member functions**

A member function defined **inside the class definition** is automatically treated as `inline`. This means the compiler is *suggested* to insert the function’s body directly at the call site, which can improve performance for very small functions.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int square(int x) { return x * x; }  // inline function
};
```

The function `square` is an **inline member function** because it’s defined within the class body.

You can also mark a member function as `inline` outside the class explicitly:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    inline int cube(int x);  // declaration
};

inline int MyClass::cube(int x) {  // definition marked inline
    return x * x * x;
}
```

### 2. **Inline member variables (C++17 and later)**

You can also have **inline variables**, which are typically `static` members declared and initialized inside the class.

**Example (C++17+):**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static inline int count = 0;  // inline static variable
};
```

This allows you to define and initialize a static variable in the class itself without needing a separate definition outside the class.

### Summary

| Inline Member Type | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inline Function    | Defined inside the class or explicitly marked `inline`                |
| Inline Variable    | `static inline` members (C++17+) defined and initialized in the class |

Absolutely — here’s both:

## 🔴 **When *not* to use `inline` in C++**

### 1. **When the function is large**

Inlining large functions increases the binary size (code bloat), which can lead to:

* Slower compilation times
* Poorer instruction cache performance
* Bigger executables

📌 **Rule of thumb:** Use inline for very small, frequently called functions — like getters/setters or simple math.

---

### 2. **When the function is recursive**

Inlining recursive functions typically doesn't work — compilers either reject it or inline only the base case.

---

### 3. **When the function is virtual**

Virtual functions are generally not inlined because they use dynamic dispatch. The compiler doesn’t know the exact function at compile time.

---

### 4. **When binary compatibility matters**

Inlining exposes the function's definition in every translation unit that includes the header. This breaks binary compatibility if the implementation changes without recompiling everything that uses it.

---

### 5. **When separation of interface and implementation is important**

Inlining functions in headers makes code changes ripple through all translation units including that header — potentially triggering more recompilation.

## 🧠 **Refresher on Static Classes in C++**

C++ **doesn’t have true "static classes"** like C# does, but you can *simulate* them.

### What you typically mean by “static class” is:

* A class that **only has static members**
* Cannot be instantiated

### ✅ **How to simulate a static class:**

```cpp
class Utils {
public:
    // Delete constructor to prevent instantiation
    Utils() = delete;

    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static void printMessage() {
        std::cout << "Hello from Utils!\n";
    }
};
```

### ✅ Usage:

```cpp
int result = Utils::add(2, 3);        // OK
Utils::printMessage();                // OK
Utils u;  // ❌ error: calling a deleted constructor
```

### 🔍 Key points:

* A "static class" is just a **class with only static members and a deleted constructor**.
* Great for **utility functions** or **namespacing constants**.
