## right choice vs feel good choice

That’s a really insightful distinction — it’s basically **“long-term value vs short-term satisfaction”**. There isn’t a perfect ratio, but here’s a framework that balances both:

---

### 1. **Prioritize the Right Choice Most of the Time**

* For things that **matter long-term** (health, career, finances, relationships), aim to make the “right” choice **70–80% of the time**.
* This keeps momentum toward your goals while still allowing flexibility.

---

### 2. **Give Yourself Permission for Feel-Good Choices**

* The remaining **20–30%** can be “feel good” choices — things that are enjoyable in the moment, even if they’re not optimal.
* These are important for **sustainability**: if you never allow yourself small pleasures, you burn out and are more likely to sabotage the “right” choices later.

---

### 3. **The 2-Minute Test**

When you’re torn:

* Ask: *“Will I regret this tomorrow?”*

  * **Yes → pick the right choice**
  * **No → enjoy the feel-good option**

* This keeps the decision practical instead of purely emotional.

---

### 4. **Combine Both When Possible**

* Sometimes you can tweak a feel-good option to make it closer to the right choice:

  * Example: Order a healthier option at Panera or smaller portion at Panda Express.
* This gives you **pleasure without derailing long-term goals**.

---

### ✅ Rule of Thumb

* **Right choice:** \~3/4 of the time
* **Feel-good choice:** \~1/4 of the time
* **Adjust based on context:** If you’re exhausted or stressed, leaning slightly toward feel-good can help you recover, but long-term, aim to make the “right” choice most days.

If you want, I can make a **simple mental framework for “Right vs Feel-Good” decisions** that you can apply instantly to lunches, workouts, coding tasks, or other daily choices. This can reduce decision fatigue and guilt. Do you want me to do that?
