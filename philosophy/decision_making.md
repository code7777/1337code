## systematic process
1 Define the decision

2 Identify criteria/values

3 List options

4 Evaluate quickly

5 Time-box thinking

6 Decide & commit

7 Test & reflect

Step 1: Define the Decision

Ask: “Exactly what am I deciding right now?”

Write it in one sentence.

Step 2: List Options (2–5 max)

Include all realistic possibilities.

Example: Lunch → Whole Foods, Panda Express, Panera.

Step 3: Quick Criteria Check (30–60 seconds)

Evaluate each option on 3 criteria:

Goal-aligned (health, work, finances)

Enjoyment / motivation

Feasibility / effort required

Use a simple 1–5 score for each.

Step 4: Time-Box Thinking

Small choices: 2–5 minutes

Medium choices: 5–15 minutes

Big choices: 30–60 minutes

Step 5: Pick & Commit

Choose the option with the best balance.

Write down the choice or say it aloud — commitment reduces second-guessing.

Step 6: Immediate Action

Take the first small step toward that choice. Action = feedback.

Step 7: Reflect Quickly

After the action, ask:

Did this meet my goals?

Did I enjoy it?

Any insight for next time?

Use reflections to adjust future decisions, not to dwell on this one.

## right choice vs feel good choice

That’s a really insightful distinction — it’s basically **“long-term value vs short-term satisfaction”**. There isn’t a perfect ratio, but here’s a framework that balances both:

---

### 1. **Prioritize the Right Choice Most of the Time**

* For things that **matter long-term** (health, career, finances, relationships), aim to make the “right” choice **70–80% of the time**.
* This keeps momentum toward your goals while still allowing flexibility.

---

### 2. **Give Yourself Permission for Feel-Good Choices**

* The remaining **20–30%** can be “feel good” choices — things that are enjoyable in the moment, even if they’re not optimal.
* These are important for **sustainability**: if you never allow yourself small pleasures, you burn out and are more likely to sabotage the “right” choices later.

---

### 3. **The 2-Minute Test**

When you’re torn:

* Ask: *“Will I regret this tomorrow?”*

  * **Yes → pick the right choice**
  * **No → enjoy the feel-good option**

* This keeps the decision practical instead of purely emotional.

---

### 4. **Combine Both When Possible**

* Sometimes you can tweak a feel-good option to make it closer to the right choice:

  * Example: Order a healthier option at Panera or smaller portion at Panda Express.
* This gives you **pleasure without derailing long-term goals**.

---

### ✅ Rule of Thumb

* **Right choice:** \~3/4 of the time
* **Feel-good choice:** \~1/4 of the time
* **Adjust based on context:** If you’re exhausted or stressed, leaning slightly toward feel-good can help you recover, but long-term, aim to make the “right” choice most days.

If you want, I can make a **simple mental framework for “Right vs Feel-Good” decisions** that you can apply instantly to lunches, workouts, coding tasks, or other daily choices. This can reduce decision fatigue and guilt. Do you want me to do that?
