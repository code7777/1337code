## how much of my time should be doing things i want to do vs doing things i feel like i have to do

That’s a thoughtful question — and there isn’t a single right answer, since it depends on your goals, responsibilities, and values. But I can break it down into a few useful ways of thinking about it:

### 1. The **Balance** View

* Many psychologists recommend something like the **80/20 principle**: aim for about **80% of your time on things you *choose* or *value*** (this includes responsibilities you’ve chosen, like working toward a career, fitness, or relationships) and **20% on things you strictly don’t want to do but must** (errands, chores, taxes, etc.).
* That ratio can shift depending on your life stage. For example, someone building a career might tilt more toward “have to” tasks temporarily.

### 2. The **Reframe** View

* Sometimes the line between “want to” and “have to” is blurry. For example:

  * Cooking might feel like a chore, but if you connect it to saving money, health, or mastery, it can become a “want.”
  * Working out might feel like a “have to” some days, but if you see it as progress toward your goals, it becomes closer to a “want.”
* Reframing turns more “have to” items into “want to” because they align with long-term values.

### 3. The **Energy** View

* Instead of measuring by hours, think about **energy spent**.

  * If your “have to” tasks are draining and leave no room for “want to” tasks, you’ll burn out.
  * If your “want to” tasks dominate and you neglect responsibilities, you’ll fall behind and build stress.

### 4. A Practical Starting Point

* Daily: Try to include **at least 1–2 meaningful “want to” activities** (things that restore or excite you).
* Weekly: Make sure the bigger responsibilities (career, health, relationships, finances) are being consistently worked on.
* Long-term: Ask, *“Will I look back and feel good about how I spent this chunk of my life?”*

👉 A good self-check: if most of your life feels like “have to,” it might be worth adjusting goals or structure. If it’s mostly “want to,” make sure you’re not sacrificing future stability.





## depth vs action ratio


---

### 1. **The “Depth vs. Action” Ratio**

* A practical rule of thumb is something like **20–30% deep thinking, 70–80% doing**.
* Deep thinking is best used for setting direction, clarifying priorities, and solving tough problems.
* Once you’ve thought through a problem enough to identify a good *enough* path, action becomes the priority. Action itself gives feedback that further guides your thinking.

---

### 2. **Set Boundaries on Thinking Time**

* Give yourself **time-boxes**: e.g. 30 minutes to analyze a decision, then commit to trying one option.
* If it’s a big life decision, maybe allow a few longer sessions — but avoid “continuous rumination.”
* You can even write: *“I’ll revisit this in 2 weeks”* instead of rehashing it daily.

---

### 3. **Shift the Frame: From Perfection to Iteration**

* Deep thinkers often want the *optimal* path before starting. But in reality, progress comes from **iteration**: doing, getting feedback, adjusting.
* Think of life like a coding project: version 1.0 doesn’t need to be perfect — you’ll patch and refactor as you go.

---

### 4. **Use Deep Thinking Where It Shines**

Deep thinking is powerful for:

* Strategy (long-term goals, life direction)
* Creativity (finding unique insights or connections others miss)
* Reflection (learning from past actions)

But for everyday decisions (what to eat, which task to start first), it’s usually better to **default to action**.

---

### 5. **Quick Self-Check Question**

When you catch yourself in a loop, ask:

* *“Am I adding new insight, or just recycling the same thoughts?”*
  If it’s recycling → switch to action.

---

✅ So maybe a good guideline for you:

* **Daily:** 15–60 minutes of structured deep thinking/reflection.
* **Rest of the day:** lean toward action, even if imperfect.

Would you like me to suggest a **simple routine** that builds in deep thinking time but protects you from getting stuck in it?

## productive deep thinking vs analysis paralysis

You’re totally right — software engineering isn’t like, say, mowing a lawn where action = progress. A lot of the job *is* mental: designing abstractions, debugging subtle issues, weighing tradeoffs. In fact, “thinking time” is often the most valuable thing you’re paid for.

That said, there’s a distinction between **productive deep thinking** and **analysis paralysis**.

---

### 1. **Productive Deep Thinking in Engineering**

* Designing system architecture before coding
* Debugging complex bugs (mentally simulating execution)
* Optimizing algorithms or data structures
* Thinking about maintainability, scalability, edge cases

This is necessary, and it *feels like slow progress*, but it prevents huge rewrites later.

---

### 2. **Unproductive Loops**

* Getting stuck trying to find *the perfect* design before writing a line of code
* Spending too long comparing small tradeoffs instead of prototyping
* Refactoring in your head without testing ideas in practice
* Re-reading the same docs without trying something

---

### 3. **A Healthier Balance for Engineers**

Instead of a fixed ratio (like 70% doing, 30% thinking), engineers often thrive with a **think → do → reflect loop**:

1. **Think (plan/outline)**: 15–30 minutes (or longer if it’s architecture-level). Write down assumptions, possible approaches.
2. **Do (prototype/experiment)**: Try an implementation, even if it’s ugly. Code = feedback.
3. **Reflect (debug/adjust)**: See what worked, what didn’t. Revise plan.

Repeat until it stabilizes.

---

### 4. **Useful Tactic: “Externalize the Thought”**

If you tend to loop in your head, push thoughts out:

* Sketch diagrams
* Write pseudocode
* Maintain a dev journal
* Rubber-duck ideas (even to ChatGPT 😅)

This forces structure and stops endless cycling.

---

### 5. **Rule of Thumb**

* **Big decisions** (system architecture, database choice, API contracts): allow more deep thought before action.
* **Smaller coding tasks**: bias toward action + iteration.

---

👉 So instead of asking *“how much time should I think vs do?”*, a better frame for software engineering might be:

**“Am I at a stage where thinking adds more value than experimenting?”**

---

Do you want me to sketch a **practical workflow for your coding sessions** that bakes in deep thinking *and* avoids paralysis?


## The “Think vs. Experiment” Rule of Thumb

Ask yourself these three questions:

 ### Do I understand the problem well enough to try something?

If the answer is no, spend a bit more thinking to clarify requirements, constraints, and assumptions.

If yes, move toward experimenting.

### Will experimenting give me new information?

If coding/prototyping will reveal unknowns or edge cases, experimenting is higher value.

If you already know what the experiment will produce and it won’t change your understanding, thinking may still be worthwhile.

### Am I spinning in loops?

If you’re cycling through the same options repeatedly without new insight, it’s time to act.

Even a “wrong” experiment produces feedback — thinking alone does not.
